Analysis shows that:
- some within-market arbitrage oppportunities exist. However, they are limited in time
- across markets, the most relevant arbitrage is on the score vs under x goals, for x above 4


Next steps:
- Implement live tracker (still delayed) to see if those opportunities exist for real (i.e. if bet can be backed)
